Select a joystick (requirements is mostly easy for pilot to use and provides some resistance/ ie not too sensitive)
Piston(maybe constant force) with a lever on an axel

	side on	<-\->  pitch   		  head on  <-|-> yaw
lever on axel 	 --D           			axel o <- this spins

using a tilt sensor for both pitch and yaw 1 pin each for 2 pins


Choose an SD card reader (figure out how much data is actually expected to be stored on it per flight)
https://surplustronics.co.nz/products/12112-sd-card-module-for-arduino if needed
with a 2GB SD card and 1 update of full screen pixel and color depth per second is worth just under half an hour
2 pins


Figuring out our requirements are important as this would indicate what type of chip we need and how components will interface with the chip and each other


total 16 pins
Battery level and instrumentation checking can be done separately from control systems but it would need 1 pin each 
totaling to 18 pins or 16 if the battery level and instrumentation checks are done by the diagnostic instrumentation/kit
Arduino is small and slow but workable for our purposes(at least for now)
esp32-wroom-32 has 23 usable GPIO pins (says more but some are boot pins that cause problems when used or for 1 use)
STM needs Mbed or Em bed but similar to Arduino 
NRF best for our use case but not user friendly 
Regardless of what chip we use, we will need a small heat radiator/sink 


Mid Priority:
Pick a chip that we could all use
Create a data budget for everything getting stored on the SD card (might be overkill if flight isn't very long)
Pick a battery for supply -> lil voltage regulator
Figure out what is needed for the linkage system / the actual control surfaces
should figure out range of motion on these and have some system that doesn't let them exceed these limits
Design a diagnostic check display that is modular and can be removed preflight -> diagnostic instruments/kit
checks battery levels, servo function, joystick control and all other instruments -> diagnostic instruments/kit

the diagnostic instruments/kit is an added device to the connector port that connects to the calibration/test systems and the control systems to check all equipment is functioning and checks battery levels


Low Priority :
Eventually for PCB need to select the following, best to have an idea of what the requirements for each are
GPS -> just get a GPS from surplustronics and log to SD card -> not the same as Altimeter
Altimeter + an external IR or similar sensor to validate take-off time -> 2nd pitot tube + strain sensor on wheel 
external ADC for noise reduction or capacitors / lowpass filter type shenanigans -> yes also inductors and multi sampling
Molex / RJ45 / whatever connector we wanna use (i can steal these from work for free so good to know which is best)
Molex for battery charging, RJ45 is harder and no charging, m12 is optimal but can be replaced by a Molex with a Bung
We need 4 pins minimum up to 8 for the connector


Considerations for later:
Using Bluetooth/RF stuff
Using buttons for control
Mounting for all these systems
Pilot interface
Control surfaces
Servos and battery
Harnessing
