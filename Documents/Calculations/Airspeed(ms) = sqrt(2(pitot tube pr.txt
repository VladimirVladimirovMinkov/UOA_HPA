Ps = Static Pressure = gotten from BME covered in fabric to prevent air speed from affecting it in hPa
Pt = pitot tube pressure = gotten from air diff sensor at end of pitot tube in hPa
Psl = Pressure at sea level = 1015hPa or manually programmed in on the day of flight
RPM = hall effect sensor times tigered over 1s averaged over 10 intervals

Pwv = Pressure of water vapor = 0.01 * H * 6.1121 * exp( (18.678 - T(C)/234.5) * T(c)/(257.14+T) )
Ad = Air Density = (Ps-Pwv)*100 / (287.05*(T(c)+273.15)) + Pwv*100 / (461.495*(T(c)+273.15)


Airspeed(m/s) = sqrt(200*(Pt - Ps)/Ad)
Altitude(m) = (Psl - Ps)*10
Orientation = Gyroscope + accelerometer for roll and pitch maybe displayed from behind the air craft
Vertical speed(m/s) = dAltitude maybe assisted with a accelerometer
Temperature(C) = temp sensor
Humidity(%) = humidity sensor
Battery level(%) = voltage level
Time from launch(mmm::ss) (Once RPM is high enough) = internal clock
Watts = RPM* 200*0.16/10

Write up short report doing some math justifying the torque on these motors -
Math from before and the EASA microlight specs and the servo selection table math and safety factor of at least 1.5x

Select a joystick (requirements is mostly easy for pilot to use and provides some resistance/ ie not too sensitive)
Piston(maybe constant force) with a lever on an axel

	side on	<-\->  pitch   		  head on  <-|-> yaw
lever on axel 	 --D           			axel o <- this spins

using a tilt sensor for both pitch and yaw 1 pin each for 2 pins


Choose an SD card reader (figure out how much data is actually expected to be stored on it per flight)
https://surplustronics.co.nz/products/12112-sd-card-module-for-arduino if needed
with a 2GB SD card and 1 update of full screen pixel and color depth per second is worth just under half an hour
2 pins


total 16 pins
Battery level and instrumentation checking can be done separately from control systems but it would need 1 pin each
totaling to 18 pins or 16 if the battery level and instrumentation checks are done by the diagnostic instrumentation/kit
Arduino is small and slow but workable for our purposes(at least for now)
esp32-wroom-32 has 23 usable GPIO pins (says more but some are boot pins that cause problems when used or for 1 use)
STM needs Mbed or Embed but similar to Arduino
NRF best for our use case but not user friendly
Regardless of what chip we use, we will need a small heat radiator/sink
