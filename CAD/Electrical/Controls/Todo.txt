Now:
1. Change Devkit to ESP32 WROOM chip (GPIO pins don't need to be changed, just transferred over for the different pin layout)
2. Decide on the servo (the previously recommended servo is no longer in production or sale)
3. Voltage regulators 
	6V to 4V for each servo
	3.3V esp32, I2C devices, SPI devices and controls
	5V for pitot tube

4. Draw up PCB
5. Review

Later:
1. Print PCB
2. Solder
3. Code
4. Test
